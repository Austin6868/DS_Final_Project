# DS_Final_Project
The repo for the Ivey Data Science course final project, <b>Team Lisbon</b>, both knitted and ```Rmd``` versions and how to run the code.

## How to get it to run?
As all of the runnable files are in the ```Rmd``` format, you will probably need [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). 

Open up the projects in RStudio, you would be able to execute all of the blocks in sequential order...

But note that you should always execute the scripts in ```ROC.Rmd``` <b>LAST</b> as it uses the cached variables from the previous data models.

## Additional Notes
The data exploration code including the graphs for age against frequency and such are in this [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DAUNbjThCl982-yP_dZO7vRI2YV2XQzZ?usp=sharing).
